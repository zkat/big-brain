// The second step is to define an action. What can the AI do, and how does it

// actually execute those actions when they're "spawned" by the Big Brain
// engine.
//
// In our case, we want the Thirst components, since we'll be changing those.
// Additionally, we want to pick up the DrinkAction components, as well as
// their associated ActionState. Note that the Drink Action belongs to a
// *separate entity* from the owner of the Thirst component!

    // ActionState is an enum that described the specific run-state the action
    // is in. You can think of Actions as state machines. They get requested,
    // they can be cancelled, they can run to completion, etc. Cancellations
    // usually happen because the target action changed (due to a different
    // Scorer winning). But you can also cancel the actions yourself by
    // setting the state in the Action system.
