// The second step is to define an action. What can the AI do, and how does it

// First, you need an Action and an ActionBuilder struct.

// These actions will be spawned and queued by the game engine when their

// Then we define an ActionBuilder, which is responsible for making new
// Action components for us.

// Associated with that Drink Action, you then need to have a system that will
// actually execute those actions when they're "spawned" by the Big Brain
// engine. This is the actual "act" part of the Action.
//
// In our case, we want the Thirst components, since we'll be changing those.
// Additionally, we want to pick up the DrinkAction components, as well as
// their associated ActionState. Note that the Drink Action belongs to a
// *separate entity* from the owner of the Thirst component!
fn drink_action_system(
    mut thirsts: Query<&mut Thirst>,
    // We grab the Parent here, because individual Actions are parented to the

    // ActionState is an enum that described the specific run-state the action
    // is in. You can think of Actions as state machines. They get requested,
    // they can be cancelled, they can run to completion, etc. Cancellations
    // usually happen because the target action changed (due to a different
    // Scorer winning). But you can also cancel the actions yourself by
    // setting the state in the Action system.

// Then, we have something called "Scorers". These are special components that
// run in the background, calculating a "Score" value, which is what Big Brain
// will use to pick which actions to execute.
//
// Just like with Actions, we use the convention of having separate
// ScorerBuilder and Scorer components. While it might seem like a lot of
// boilerplate, in a "real" application, you will almost certainly have data
// and configuration concerns. This pattern separates those nicely.
