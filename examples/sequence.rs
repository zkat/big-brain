//! This example describes how to create an action that takes multiple steps.
//!
//! It is similar to the thirst example, but instead of just magically quenching a thirst,
//! the actor must be near a water source in order to drink.
//!
//! Note that it does not matter if the actor is already near a water source:
//! the MoveToWaterSource action will simply terminate immediately.
